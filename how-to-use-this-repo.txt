1. Install git on your local computer. 

	https://git-scm.com/downloads


2. Set up your username and email from terminal (will be published with all commits for identification):

	2.1 set user name:
		$ git config --global user.name "myNameHere"
	
	2.2 set email:
		$ git config --global user.email "myEmailHere@gmail.com"


3. create a folder on your local computer 

4. Within the folder, right click and open terminal or  cd to the folder, then intialize git: 

	4.1 Initializes git for the directory the terminal is in:
		$ git init

5. Add/Create a file(s) that will be edited ( will contain your content for contribution ), then add and commit locally, for example file fly.py:

	5.1 After file is created or moved into the folder, check git status (not mandatory, just good to see what's happening):
		$ git status
	
	5.2 "Add" content, which means it is ready to be submitted, where submit is called commit:
		$ git add fly.py

	5.3 After add, check git status (not mandatory, just good to see what's happening):
		$ git status

	5.4 "Commit" content, which means is has been submitted:
		$ git add fly.py
	
	5.5 After commit, check git status (not mandatory, just good to see what's happening):
		$ git status

		$ git branch

	6.2 create new branch (will be your branch)
		$ git branch myBranchNameHere
	
	6.3 Check what branches are on local machine, and asterisk will be beside current branch (not mandatory, just good to see what's happening):
		$ git branch

	6.4 Switch  to your branch (the following example would switch to branch we created named myBranchNameHere):
		$ git checkout myBranchNameHere

7. Add our shared github repo as your remote repo:
	
	7.1 Set your remote repo:
		$ git remote add origin https://github.com/lrmcc/RoboticsFinal.git

8. When ready to "Push" (submit) branch content to our branchshared github repo, requires into github:
		$ git push -u origin myBranchNameHere

9. Group will decide and merge master branch
