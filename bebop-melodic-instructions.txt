To setup the Bebop software:

sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-parrot-arsdk

In your ROS Workspace/src directory:
1. git clone https://github.com/AutonomyLab/bebop_autonomy.git
2. cd ..
3. catkin_make

For the following instructions, ROS_WS refers to your ROS workspace base directory:
1. In ROS_WS/devel/include: sudo ln -s /opt/ros/melodic/include/parrot_arsdk parrot_arsdk
2. In ROS_WS/devel/library: sudo ln -s /opt/ros/melodic/lib/parrot_arsdk parrot_arsdk
3. In your ~/.bashrc file, add the following to the end, replacing "my_username" with your username:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/my_username/ROS/devel/lib/parrot_arsdk:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

In the bebop_autonomy/bebop_driver/launch directory, edit bebop_node.launch and change the following:
  1. Set the drone_type argument to "bebop2" (instead of "bebop1")

To run the Bebop ROS Node:
  1. Start your Bebop2 drone by pressing the button on the back
  2. Connect your computer to its WiFi network
  3. Make sure you "source devel/setup.bash" from your ROS Workspace directory
  3. roslaunch bebop_driver bebop_node.launch

To test your connection to the Bebop2:
  1. "rostopic list" will show the Bebop2 topics
  2. Running "rosrun image_view image_view image:=/bebop/image_raw" will allow you to view the camera output
